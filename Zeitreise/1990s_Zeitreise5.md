##  Revolution

In the **1990s**, one of the greatest transformations in software history began:  
The **birth of the World Wide Web** (Tim Berners-Lee, 1991) and the **rise of open-source communities** (Linux, 1991) turned software from an exclusive product into a **global, shared resource**.  

The web connected developers across the world, while open source created a culture of **collaboration, transparency, and innovation**.
